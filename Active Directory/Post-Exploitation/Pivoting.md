## Proxy Chains 
Proxychains is a command line tool which is activated by prepending the command proxychains to other commands. For example, to proxy netcat  through a proxy, you could use the command:
**proxychains nc 172.16.0.10 23**<br>

## SSH Tunneling
### Forward Connection
Port forwarding is accomplished with the -L switch, which creates a link to a Local port. For example, if we had SSH access to 172.16.0.5 and there's a webserver running on 172.16.0.10, we could use this command to create a link to the server on 172.16.0.10:<br>
**ssh -L 8000:172.16.0.10:80 user@172.16.0.5 -fN**<p>
We could then access the website on 172.16.0.10 (through 172.16.0.5) by navigating to port 8000 on our own attacking machine. For example, by entering **localhost:8000** into a web browser.<p>
Proxies are made using the -D switch, for example: -D 1337. This will open up port 1337 on your attacking box as a proxy to send data through into the protected network. An example of this command would be:<br>
**ssh -D 1337 user@172.16.0.5 -fN** </p>

### Revesere Connection

1. ssh-KeyGen
2. Copy the contents of the public key (the file ending with .pub), then edit the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on your own attacking machine. You may need to create the ~/.ssh directory and authorized_keys file first.
3. On a new line, type the following line, then paste in the public key:
**command="echo 'This account can only be used for port forwarding'",no-agent-forwarding,no-x11-forwarding,no-pty**

4. sudo systemctl status ssh
5. sudo systemctl start ssh

 To put that into the context of our fictitious **IPs: 172.16.0.10 and 172.16.0.5**, if we have a shell on 172.16.0.5 and want to give **our attacking box (172.16.0.20)** access to the webserver on 172.16.0.10, we could use this command on the 172.16.0.5 machine:
**ssh -R 8000:172.16.0.10:80 kali@172.16.0.20 -i KEYFILE -fN**
